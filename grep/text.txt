		Sweet Dreams

	Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something.

	Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused.

	Sweet dreams are made of this dream dream
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something.

	Hold your head up
Keep your head up, Movin' on,
Hold your head up, Movin' on,
Keep your head up, Movin' on,
Hold your head up, Movin' on,
Keep your head up, Movin' on,
Hold your head up, Movin' on,
Keep your head up.
